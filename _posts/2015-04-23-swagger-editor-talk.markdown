Here are my slides my talk that I gave in [SouthBay JavaScript](http://www.meetup.com/southbayjs/events/221522790/) Meetup about my experience building [Swagger Editor](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor)

If you're not familiar with [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) check it out. It's very useful for starting microservices quickly or generate documentations for you API automatically.
